Question-1
Discuss the ways using suitable examples in which inheritance promotes software reuse,
saves time during program development and helps prevent errors.

Answer--
Inheritance allows developers to create derived classes that reuse code declared already in a base class. Avoiding the 
duplication of common functionality between several classes by building an inheritance hierarch to contain the classes 
can save developers a considerable amount of time.
Similarly , placing common functionality in a single base class, rather than duplication the code in multiple 
unrelated classes, helps prevent the same errors from appearing in multiple source-code file.
If several classes each contain duplicate code containing an error, the software developer has to spend time correcting 
each source- code file with the error.
However, if these classes take advantages of inheritance , and the errors occurs in the common functionality of the base
class, the software developer needs to modify only the base class's code.

Other example of software reuse:-
Using function available in some library.
C libraries are collections of precomplied functions that have been written to be reused by other programmers.
